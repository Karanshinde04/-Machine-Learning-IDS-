## ‚ú® Features
- Detects network intrusions using ML algorithms  
- Supports both **static and live data analysis**  
- Provides **data preprocessing** and **feature selection**  
- Uses **classification algorithms** (Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, etc.)  
- Generates **detailed accuracy reports** and confusion matrices  
- Easily extendable for **real-time detection**
